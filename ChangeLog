28th June 2002, Simon Goodall
 * Implemented basic Log object to eventually replace all cout / cerr / DEBUG msgs

 * Fixed a bug that stopped Sear working with Stage
 * Added a change directory function to scripting engine
 * Added ability to prefix current directory to entiries on loading into config data
