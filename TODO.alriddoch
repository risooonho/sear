 Idea:

   Keep track in System of the last time mouse or joystick modified view.
   If neither have for a short time, then run procEvent to find out
   what we are pointing at.

   Test joystick button code, and pick some suitable buttons.

   Add chat entry using enter.

   Do shit loads of work on the server map layout.

   Chickens!
