StaticObject destructor called after GL context is destroyed!
Segfault on WorldEntity::getType() on world init

calling /take for a second time is bad !!
calling /disconnect doesn't stop rendering the world view

Random Crashes on ATI based hardware. Typically when in the game world. More often on Win32. Valgrind reports numerous errors in the GL library. Perhaps something to do with this.

Need to check init functions. They do not always clean up in event of failure (e.g. System::init();


Many warning are given about initialised values in Sear::Frustrum::patchInFrustrum,
with the error being in wfmath/point.h lines 199, 203 and 207

_seconds_counter is used initialised the first time Sear::Calendar::update() is called.

BUGS
 * Text box sometimes  repeatslast 3/4 chars across lines
 * out by one on terrain

 * some problems with multi texturing on cal3d when model doesn't have any second texture (or even first!) breaks alpha-mapping
 * segfaults with fullscreen - win32 on call, linux when quitting

 * Fix font length problems
   - The font in many cases will not clip to the screen and go onto the next line. This is a problem on the console fonts, but no so much for the floating character speech
 
 * WIN32 Segfault after initLighting is called. Problem caused with certain sets of data in the general.cfg file. Below is an example that will cause a problem:

[general]

iconfile = "./data/sear_icon.bmp"
mouse_move_select = "false"

[render]

render_show_fps = "false"
render_use_lighting = "false"

[terrain]

height_map = "./data/agrilan_hm.png"
