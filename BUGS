BUGS
 * Some problems with Atlas stuff in Character.cpp -> Need to check with James

 * Still some object selection bugs.
   - For the most part selection works as expected, athough there still arises some occasions where an object will not get selected!

 * Fix font length problems
   - The font in many cases will not clip to the screen and go onto the next line. This is a problem on the console fonts, but no so much for the floating character speech
 * Add weather effects
