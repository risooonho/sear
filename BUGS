BUGS
 * Still some object selection bugs.
   - For the most part selection works as expected, athough there still arises some occasions where an object will not get selected!

 * Fix font length problems
   - The font in many cases will not clip to the screen and go onto the next line. This is a problem on the console fonts, but no so much for the floating character speech
 
 * 3Ds loader does not work on all models. e.g. jarnosun's bugbear/lizardman and drow models seem to be defined differently to other 3ds models and so currently will not work
