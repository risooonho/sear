BUGS
 * Fix font length problems
   - The font in many cases will not clip to the screen and go onto the next line. This is a problem on the console fonts, but no so much for the floating character speech
 
 * WIN32 Segfault after initLighting is called. Problem caused with certain sets of data in the general.cfg file. Below is an example that will cause a problem:

[general]

iconfile = "./data/sear_icon.bmp"
mouse_move_select = "false"

[render]

render_show_fps = "false"
render_use_lighting = "false"

[terrain]

height_map = "./data/agrilan_hm.png"
