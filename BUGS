BUGS

 * Crashes if connected to a server when cyclient is run. Long standing eris issue?


Demitar Issues:
	* Dropping items (e.g. merchant) broken. He has *lots* of stuff
	* Lighting probs. Wolf vs torch -- The torches/other fires still
 	  need working on
 	* Suspend/resume sear eats up memory
	* dropping rotating stake crashes sear
 

* GUI transitions need more work. Close should ideally go back a step if required. 

 * The StaticObject stores indices as an int, but tells GL they are unsigned ints. Might cause a problem somewhere along the line. 

 * Entity bounding box is not the same as the visual bounding box. Objects are clipped when their entity bbox is no longer in the frustum. We need to calculate the visual bbox and clip to that instead.

 * The settler animation for walking goes funny sometimes when starting up. Could be a malebuiler animation problem, or could be some bad interaction in the mixer.

 * Random Crashes on ATI based hardware. Typically when in the game world. More often on Win32. Valgrind reports numerous errors in the GL library. Perhaps something to do with this.

Need to check init functions. They do not always clean up in event of failure (e.g. System::init();

 * Text box sometimes  repeatslast 3/4 chars across lines

 * some problems with multi texturing on cal3d when model doesn't have any second texture (or even first!) breaks alpha-mapping
