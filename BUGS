Many warning are given about initialised values in Sear::Frustrum::patchInFrustrum,
with the error being in wfmath/point.h lines 199, 203 and 207

_seconds_counter is used initialised the first time Sear::Calendar::update() is called.

BUGS
 * Text box sometimes  repeatslast 3/4 chars across lines
 * out by one on terrain

 * some problems with multi texturing on cal3d when model doesn't have any second texture (or even first!) breaks alpha-mapping
 * segfaults with fullscreen - win32 on call, linux when quitting

 * Fix font length problems
   - The font in many cases will not clip to the screen and go onto the next line. This is a problem on the console fonts, but no so much for the floating character speech
 
 * WIN32 Segfault after initLighting is called. Problem caused with certain sets of data in the general.cfg file. Below is an example that will cause a problem:

[general]

iconfile = "./data/sear_icon.bmp"
mouse_move_select = "false"

[render]

render_show_fps = "false"
render_use_lighting = "false"

[terrain]

height_map = "./data/agrilan_hm.png"
