BUGS

 * Double-clicking on an empty characters list, then selecting a character type
   appears to break guichan.

 * The lighting flickers on some objects when others fade in. Seems like a flag is not being reset, or is somehow being shared across all copies. Typically on model_by_type objects.

 * /reload_configs can lead to funny textures being used where the default was used before

 * /reload_configs clear worn entities.

 * Crashes if connected to a server when cyclient is run. Long standing eris issue?

 * Terrain Textures do not always render correctly. usually happens if the segment changes/is added when connected

 * The getHeight function fails if a segment has not been populated,e.g. because it is outside of the view frustrum.

 * The server list needs sorting out to hide (or just not show initially) servers which are unavailable.
 
 * Drop down list should have up/down keys and search by first letter (or serveral letters)

 * Mercator has no way to remove additions to surfaces. This is a problem when
   tree area's need to be removed as they are currently leaked.


Demitar Issues:
	* Dropping items (e.g. merchant) broken. He has *lots* of stuff
	* Lighting probs. Wolf vs torch -- The torches/other fires still
 	  need working on
 	* Suspend/resume sear eats up memory
	* dropping rotating stake crashes sear
 

* GUI transitions need more work. Close should ideally go back a step if required. 

 * The StaticObject stores indices as an int, but tells GL they are unsigned ints. Might cause a problem somewhere along the line. 

 * Entity bounding box is not the same as the visual bounding box. Objects are clipped when their entity bbox is no longer in the frustum. We need to calculate the visual bbox and clip to that instead.

 * The settler animation for walking goes funny sometimes when starting up. Could be a malebuiler animation problem, or could be some bad interaction in the mixer.

 * Random Crashes on ATI based hardware. Typically when in the game world. More often on Win32. Valgrind reports numerous errors in the GL library. Perhaps something to do with this.

Need to check init functions. They do not always clean up in event of failure (e.g. System::init();

 * Text box sometimes  repeatslast 3/4 chars across lines

 * some problems with multi texturing on cal3d when model doesn't have any second texture (or even first!) breaks alpha-mapping
